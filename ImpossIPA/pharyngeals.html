<h1>List of possible and impossible pharyngeals:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Pharyngeal stops: [q̠] [ɢ̠] - the IPA shades the latter impossible, and some unofficial charts shade both, but maybe perhaps it's just a little difficult.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal nasals: [ɴ̠̊] [ɴ̠] - difficult or impossible, IPA shades both impossible.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal trills: [ʀ̠̊] [ʀ̠] - not shaded by the IPA, but shaded by the extIPA, maybe perhaps it's just a little difficult.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal taps or flaps: [q̠̆] [ɢ̠̆] - not officially shaded, but may be shaded on some unofficial charts, perhaps just difficult.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal fricatives: [ħ] [ʕ] - definitely possible and occurs in some languages like Arabic, though the latter is difficult to have frication according to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal lateral fricatives: [ʟ̠̊˔] [ʟ̠˔] - shaded impossible, though that quote shows that they are possible.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal approximants: [ħ̞] [ʕ̞] - the latter is definitely possible and occurs in at least Danish, while the first one stays theoretically possible if no languages have it.</li>
<li>Pharyngeal lateral approximants: [ʟ̠̊] [ʟ̠] - same with the pharyngeal lateral fricatives.</li>
</ul>
