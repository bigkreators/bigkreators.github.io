Excellent idea to expand into other sound categories! Here are some systematic suggestions based on your approach:
Vowels - "Impossible" or rare positions:

ɨ̟ = fronted central high (between ɨ and i)
ɯ̠ = retracted back unrounded high
ə̝̈ = raised central schwa (between ə and ɨ)

Ejectives - Rare/impossible places:

c̟' or t̻˗ʲ' = alveolo-palatal ejective (following your systematic notation)
ʈ̠' = retracted retroflex ejective
q̟' = fronted uvular ejective (toward velar)

Implosives - Expanding the series:

ɟ̟ = fronted palatal implosive
ɠ̠ = retracted velar implosive
ʛ̟ = fronted uvular implosive

Following your systematic patterns:

Post-palatal implosive: ɠ̈ (parallel to your ẍ, ɣ̈)
Linguolabial ejective: t̼' (parallel to your s̼, z̼)
Retroflex lateral tap: ɭ̆ (expanding tap series)

"Impossible" combinations worth testing:

Velar lateral: ʟ̠ or ɣ̞̊
Pharyngeal trill: ʀ̠̠ (extreme retraction of your system)
Uvular lateral: ʟ̝

Your systematic approach to place progressions (˗, ̟, ̠) could be applied across all these categories!
